Introduction to C Language:

C language was developed Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at AT&T Bell Laboratories (USA). C language was derived from B language which was developed by Ken Thomson in 1970. This B language was adopted from a language BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language), which was developed by Martin Richards at Cambridge University. The language B named as so by borrowing the first initial from BCPL language. Dennis Ritchie modified and improved B language and named it as C language, using second initial from BCPL.

C language is not high level language and not a low level language. It is a middle level language with high level and low level features.

C is a general purpose, structured programming language. C language is one of the most popular computer languages today because it is a structured, high level, machine independent language. It allows software developers to develop software without worrying about the hardware platforms where they will be implemented.

Importance of C
It is a robust language whose rich set of built in functions and operators can be used to write any complex program. The C compiler combines the capabilities of an assembly language with the features of a higher level language and therefore it is well suited for both system software and business packages.

Features
C is a general purpose language

C can be used for system programming as well as application programming.

C is middle level language C is portable language
An application program written on C language will work on many different computers with little or no modifications.

C Block structured language. In C , a block is marked by two curly braces({ })

C programs are compact, fast and efficient C is case sensitive language
C is function oriented language



 

C language includes advanced data types like pointers, structures, unions, enumerated types etc.

C language supports recursion and dynamic storage allocation C can manipulate with bits, bytes and addresses
Parameter passing can be done using call-by-value and call-by-reference Why Use c?
1.	Powerful and flexible
C is a powerful and flexible language. The language itself places no constraints on you. C is used for projects as diverse as operating systems, Word Processors, graphics, spreadsheets, and even compilers for other languages.
2.	Popular
C is a popular language preferred by professional programmers. As a result, a wide variety of C compilers and helpful accessories are available for use by programmers.
3.	Portable
C is a portable language. Portable means that a C program written for one computer system (say an IBM PC) can be compiled and run on another system (say a DEC VAX system) with little or no modification. Portability is enhanced by the ANSI standard for C, the set of rules for C compilers.
4.	Minimum keywords
C is a language of few words, containing only a handful of terms, called keywords, which serve as the base on which the language's functionality is built. There is a misconception with many that a language with more key words (sometimes called reserved words) would be more powerful. This isn't true.
5.	Modular
C is a modular. C code can (and should) be written in routines called functions. These functions can be reused in other applications or programs. By passing pieces of information to the functions, you can create useful, reusable code.

Execution Characters
The meaning of these characters is interpreted at the time of execution. These are also known as “Escape sequences because the backslash (\) is considered as an ‘escape’ character. It causes an escape from normal interpretation of a string. so that the next character is recognized as one having special meaning.

Escape sequences
Escape
sequence	Meaning	Result

\b	Backspace	Moves the cursor to the previous position of the current
line.
\a	Bell(alert)	Produces a beep sound for alert

 


\r	Carriage return	Moves the cursor to beginning of the current line.
\n	New line	Moves the cursor to beginning of the next line.
\0	Null	Null character
\v	Vertical tab	Moves the cursor to next vertical tab position.
\t	Horizontal tab	Moves the cursor to next horizontal tab position.
\\	Backslash	Present a character with backslash(\)
Data Types of C
C supports different types of data. The type or Data type refers a type of data that is going to be stored in variable. Data types can be broadly classified as shown in figure




C provides a standard minimal set of data types. Sometimes these are also called as ‘Primitive types’. They are:
‘char’ is used to store any single character. ‘int’ is used to store integer value.
‘float’ is used to store floating point value and
‘double’ is used for storing long range of floating point number.

Type Qualifiers
In addition, C has four type qualifiers, also known as type modifiers which precede the basic data type. A type modifier alters the meaning of basic data type to yield a new data type. They are as follows:
short
long ( to increase the size of an int or double type) signed
unsigned

The qualifiers can be classified into two types: Size qualifier (e.g., short and long)
Sign qualifier (e.g., signed and unsigned)
Size qualifiers: alters the size of basic data type. The keywords long and short are two size qualifiers. For example:
long int i;

 

The size of int is 2 bytes but, when long keyword is used, that variable will be either 4 bytes or 8 bytes.

Sign qualifiers: Whether a variable can hold only positive value or both values is specified by sign qualifiers. Keywords signed and unsigned are used for sign qualifiers.

Each of these type modifiers can be applied to base type int.
The modifiers signed and unsigned can also be applied to base type char. In addition long can also be applied to double.
When base type is omitted from a declaration, int is assumed.

Example

short int a; // 16 bits, range -32,768 to 32,767 unsigned short int b; // 16 bits, range 0 to 65,535 unsigned int c; // 32 bits, range 0 to 4,294,967,295



Data Type	Size (in Bytes)	Range
char	1	-128 to 127
unsigned char	1	0 to 255
signed char	1	-128 to 127
int	2	-32768 to 32767
unsigned int	2	0 to 65535
signed int	2	-32768 to 32767
short int	2	-32768 to 32767
unsigned short int	2	0 to 65535

signed short int	2	-32768 to 32767
long int	4	-2147483648 to 2147483647
unsigned long int	4	0 to 4294967295
signed long int	4	-2147483648 to 2147483647
float	4	3.4E-38 to 3.4E +38
double	8	1.7E-308 to 1.7E+308
long double	10	3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932

void type
This type holds no value and thus valueless. It is primarily used in three cases:
To specify the return type of a function (when the function returns no value)
To specify the parameters of the function (when the function accepts no arguments from the caller.)
  To create generic pointers.





 

2.3	Various kinds of C Data(Tokens) The data in C language can be divided into
Constants/literals Variables/Identifiers Reserved Words/Key words Delimiters
Constants
Constant can be defined as a value that can be stored in memory and cannot be changed during execution of the program. Constants are used to define fixed values like pi. C has four basic types of constants. They are:

Integer Constant
An integer constant must have at least one digit and should not have a decimal point. It can be either positive or negative.
Examples for integer constants 1	9	234	999
Floating point Constant
A floating point constant is decimal number that contains either a decimal point or an exponent. In the other words, they can be written in 2 forms: fractional and exponential.
When expressed in fractional form, note the following points.
  There should be at least one digit, and could be either positive or negative value. A decimal point is must.
  There should be no commas or blanks.
Examples for fractional form
12.33	-19.56	+123.89 -0.7
When expressed in exponential form, a floating point constant will have 2 parts. One is before e and after it. The part which appears before e is known as mantissa and the one which follows is known as exponent. When expressed in this format, note the following points.

mantissa and exponential should be separated by letter E. mantissa can have a positive and negative sign.
default is positive.


 

Examples for fractional form

2E-10	0.5e2	1.2E+3	-5.6E-2

Character Constant
These are single character enclosed in single quotes. A character can be single alphabet, single digit, single special symbol enclosed with in single quotes. Not more than a single character is allowed.

Example

‘a’	‘Z’	‘5’	‘$’

String Constant
A String constant is sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. So “a” is not same as ‘a’. The characters comprising the string constant are stored in successive memory locations.
Example: “ Hello World”


Variables/Identifiers
Variable is named memory location that can be used to store values. These variables can take different values but one value at a time. These values can be changed during execution of a program.
Identifiers are basically names given to program elements such as variables, arrays and functions.

Rules for naming a Variable/Identifier
1.	The only characters allowed are alphabets, digits and underscore (_).
2.	They must start with an alphabet or an underscore (_).
3.	It can not include any special characters or punctuation marks (like #, $, ^, ?, ., etc.) except underscore (_).
4.	They can be of any reasonable length. They should not contain more than 31 characters. But it is preferable to use 8 characters.
5.	There cannot be two successive underscores.
6.	Reserved words/keywords cannot be identifiers.
7.	Lower case or uppercase letters are significant.

Key words
These are also called as reserved words.
All Keywords have fixed meanings and these meanings cannot be changed. There are 32 keywords in C programming.
Keywords serve as basic building blocks for a program statement. All keywords must be written in lowercase only.

 



ANSI C Keywords
auto	double	int	struct
break	else	long	switch
case	enum	register	typedef
char	extern	return	union
const	float	short	unsigned
continue	for	signed	void
default	goto	sizeof	volatile
do	if	static	while
Delimiters
Delimiters are used for syntactic meaning in C. These are given below:

Symbol	Name	Meaning
:	Colon	Used for label
;	Semicolon	End of statement
( )	Parenthesis	Used in expression
[ ]	Square brackets	Used in expression
{ }	Curly braces	Used for block of statements
#	Hash	Pre-processor directive
,	Comma	Variable separator

2.4	Variables:
A variable is named memory location that stores a value. When using a variable, we actually refer to address of the memory where the data is stored. C language supports two basic kinds of variables:
Numeric variables Character variables

Numeric variables
Numeric variables can be used to store either integer values or floating point values. While an integer value is a whole number without a fraction part or decimal point. A floating point value can have a decimal point.

Numeric values may be associated with modifiers like short, long, signed, and unsigned.

Character variables:
Character variables can include any letter from the alphabet or from ASCII chart and numbers 0-9 that are given within single quotes.

Variable declaration:
To declare a variable, specify the data type of the variable followed by its name. The data type indicates the kind of data that the variable will store. Variable names should

 

always be meaningful and must reflect the purpose of their usage in the program. In C, variable declaration always ends with a semicolon, for example:

char grade; int emp_no; float salary;
double bal_amount unsigned short int acc_no;

C allows multiple variable of same type to be declared in one statement, so the following statement is absolutely legal in C
float temp_in_deg, temp_in_farh;

Initializing variables
Assigning value to variable is called variable initialization. For example:
char grade= ‘A’; int emp_no=1007;
float salary=8750.25;
double bal_amount=100000000

When variables are declared but not initialized they usually contain garbage values.
Basically variable declaration can be done in three different places in a C program.
1)	Inside main() function are called local variables.
2)	Outside main() function are called global variables.
3)	In the function definition header are called formal parameters.

Declaring Constants
To declare a constant, precede the normal variable declaration with const keyword and assign it a value. For example,
const float pi=3.1415;
This const keyword specifies that the value of cannot change.
C Input Functions:
C programming language provides built-in functions to perform input operations. The input operations are used to read user values (input) from the keyboard. The c programming language provides the following built-in input functions.

1.	scanf()
2.	getchar()
3.	getch()
4.	gets()

1.	scanf():
 

The scanf() function is used to read multiple data values of different data types from the keyboard. The scanf() function is built-in function defined in a header file called "stdio.h".

Example Program: #include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>
void main()
{
int i;
printf("\nEnter any integer value: "); scanf("%d",&i);
printf("\nYou have entered %d number",i);
}
Example Program:
#include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>

void main(){ int i;
float x;
printf("\nEnter one integer followed by one float value : "); scanf("%d%f",&i, &x);
printf("\ninteger = %d, float = %f",i, x);


}
2.	getchar():

The getchar() function is used to read a character from the keyboard and return it to the program. This function is used to read a single character.


Example Program #include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>

 


void main(){ char ch;
printf("\nEnter any character : "); ch = getchar();
printf("\nYou have entered : %c\n",ch);
}
3.	getch():

The getch() function is similar to getchar function. The getch() function is used to read a character from the keyboard and return it to the program

Example Program:
#include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h> void main(){
char ch;
printf("\nEnter any character : "); ch = getch();
printf("\nYou have entered : %c",ch);


}

4.	gets():

The gets() function is used to read a line of string and stores it into a character array. The gets() function reads a line of string or sequence of characters till a newline symbol enters.

Example Program: #include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>
void main(){ char name[30];
printf("\nEnter your favourite website: "); gets(name);
printf("%s",name);
}

 


C Output Functions:
C programming language provides built-in functions to perform output operation. The output operations are used to display data on user screen (output screen) or printer or any file.
1.	printf()
2.	putchar()
3.	puts()

1.	printf():

The printf() function is used to print string or data values or a combination of string and data values on the output screen (User screen). The printf() function is built-in function defined in a header file called "stdio.h".

Example Program: #include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>
void main(){ int i = 10; float x = 5.5;
printf("%d %f",i, x);
}

2.	Putchar():

The putchar() function is used to display a single character on the output screen. The putchar() functions prints the character which is passed as a parameter to it and returns the same character as a return value. This function is used to print only a single character.

Example Program: #include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>

void main(){ char ch = 'A'; putchar(ch);
}


 

3.	Puts():

The puts() function is used to display a string on the output screen. The puts() functions prints a string or sequence of characters till the newline.

Example Program: #include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>
void main(){ char name[30];
printf("\nEnter your favourite website: "); gets(name);
puts(name);
}
C Storage Classes:
In C programming language, storage classes are used to define things like storage location (whether RAM or REGISTER), scope, lifetime and the default value of a variable.
In the C programming language, the memory of variables is allocated either in computer memory (RAM) or CPU Registers. The allocation of memory depends on storage classes

1.	auto storage class
2.	extern storage class
3.	static storage class
4.	register storage class

1.	auto storage class:

The default storage class of all local variables (variables declared inside block or function) is auto storage class. Variable of auto storage class has the following properties...




 


 
Storage	Computer Memory (RAM)


Scope	Local to the block in which the variable is defined


Example Program 1:
#include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h> int main(){
int i;
auto char c; float f;
printf("i = %d\tc = %c\tf = %f",i,c,f); return 0;
}

2.	extern storage class:
The default storage class of all global varibles (variables declared outside function) is external storage class. Variable of external storage class has the following properties...

Storage	Computer Memory (RAM)





 


 
Scope	Global to the program (i.e., Throughout the program)


Example Program 1;

#include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>

int  i;	//By  default  it  is  extern  variable int main(){
printf("%d",i); return  0;
}
3.	static storage class:
The static storage class is used to create variables that hold value beyond its scope until the end of the program. The static variable allows to initialize only once and can be modified any number of times. Variable of static storage class has the following properties...

Storage	Computer Memory (RAM)


Scope	Local to the block in which the variable is defined



 


Property	Description
Life time	The value of the done only once)	persists	between	different	function	calls	(i.e., Initialization	is
Example Program 1:

#include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>

static int a; int main(){
printf("%d",a); return  0;
}
4.	register storage class:

The register storage class is used to specify the memory of the variable that has to be allocated in CPU Registers. The memory of the register variable is allocated in CPU Register but not in Computer memory (RAM). The register variables enable faster accessibility compared to other storage class variables. As the number of registers inside the CPU is very less we can use very less number of register variables. Variable of register storage class has the following properties...

Storage	CPU Register


Scope	Local to the block in which the variable is defined





 


 
Example Program 1:

#include<stdio.h> #include<conio.h>

int main(){
register  int  a,b; scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
printf("%d	%d",a,b);
}
Structure of a C Program
C program is a collection of one or more functions. Every function is collection of statements, performs a specific task. The structure of a basic C program is:
